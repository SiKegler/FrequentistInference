# Frequentist_Inference_Case_Study
Welcome to part A of the Frequentist inference case study! The purpose of this case study is to help you apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Frequentist inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, you'll practice writing Python code to apply the following statistical concepts: 
* the _z_-statistic
* the _t_-statistic
* the difference and relationship between the two
* the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
* how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval
